# List of Input elements and form tags:

* form - The HTML <form> element represents a document section that contains interactive controls to submit information to a web server.

* fieldset - The HTML <fieldset> element is used to group several controls as well as labels (<label>) within a web form.

* div - The HTML <div> element is the generic container for flow content and does not inherently represent anything. Use it to group elements for purposes such as styling (using the class or id attributes), marking a section of a document in a different language (using the lang attribute), and so on.

* label - The HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

* input - The HTML <input> element is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms in order to accept data from the user.

* select - The HTML <select> element represents a control that provides a menu of options:

* option - The HTML <option> element is used to define an item contained in a <select>, an <optgroup>, or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of items in an HTML document.

* button - The HTML <button> element represents a clickable button.
